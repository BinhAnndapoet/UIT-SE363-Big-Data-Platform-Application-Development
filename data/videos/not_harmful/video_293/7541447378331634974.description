My favorite comfort food in the autumn season. Freshly picked vegetables smell like heaven and I have chosen the perfect recipe for today, Moussaka! Moussaka is to the Greek what Lasagna is to Italians. A rich tomato meat sauce layered with eggplant instead of pasta sheets, and topped with a thick layer of béchamel sauce, this traditional Greek recipe takes time to assemble – but it’s well worth the effort!Ingredients For the Meat Sauce • Extra virgin olive oil • Onion • Garlic cloves • Ground lamb or beef • Sea salt • Black pepper • Ground cinnamon • Ground nutmeg • Tomato paste • Crushed tomatoes • Dry red wine • Bay leaf For the Vegetables • Eggplants • Salt • Oil For the Béchamel Sauce • All-purpose flour • Butter • Whole milk, warmed • Sea salt • Black pepper • Ground nutmeg • Parmesan cheese, grated • Egg yolk
